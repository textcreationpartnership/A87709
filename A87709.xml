            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Secondly I shall let them see how difficult it is in overturning times to be prudently acted. Thirdly that the sin is great in not submiting to the power that God sets over them. And then in the next place wherein the fifth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy men are erroniously precipitated shall in Christs name be discovered.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p> That they may not be ignorant to see Gods presence with the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by these marks we may conclude, that the supreme power that is to be exalted must never lose drop of blood by his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or any time was taken prisoner, which was fulfilled (as I am credibly informed) in his Highnesse the <hi>Lord Protectour,</hi> as in <hi>David, Julius Caesar, &amp;c.</hi> was verified: matter of admiration, rather then of positive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.</p>
                  <p>Yet this is that which in the name of Christ must be said and justified; <hi>That that power which the Lord of Hoasts hath so blessed, and made to prosper, that there is none of the beaten enemies to be found either in field, or in the Garrison, that can or dare oppose or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the same; but that all the people do yield, or are either actively or passively made subject: is the power that God sets up over the people, unto which by God they are required to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to his exalted servant, which he by his own will and power (neither to be murmured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst or resisted) hath set over them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, as to our prayers being ended, we are to say <hi>Amen;</hi> so at the Ultimate suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess and conclusion of a conquest, we must needs say something, either that we are, or we are not conquered, if conquered, then
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170580:6"/>there is a power set over us, which hath conquered us, which to see and not acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge is to play the fool, or murmur against God, to whom the successe of the battail is to be ascribed. In that then I do not know nor have heard from any particular Country man or Country, that there is a face of an enemy, that can withold, or doth not pay the Tribute which is the supreme Magistrates due, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. Therfore I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that his Highness whom God in his his own person hath covered his head in the greatest Battells, in the three Nations <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> is a most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouslly exalted supreme, which God hath set over us; which is to be by all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and obeyed in all Christian sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; unto whom the Parlament put the Scepter into his hand, begirt him with the sword of power, and inrobed him with that Garment which is sutable to a supreme Majesty.</p>
                  <p>And so visible is the face of Gods exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him: That if his Highness would give leave for the contrary party to pitch the field, Gods presence would as much now; or would far more, then some ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine appear: that I should not fear in this cause, but that the Lord would most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170580:7"/>Triumph over them, I mean all his enemies that should appear against the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>And this I hope in the strength of Christ would also appear; that there is not a tongue which shall deceive or speak proud words, as there is but too many. But being known, it would appear that the Lord hath also given (as he promised) a mouth and tongue to gain say them.</p>
                  <p>And though it may be said that some do decline, yet that the Channell doth not want the influence, or that by their decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, a greater Number is not decreased, is that which cannot be denyed; for it comforteth the heart of every honest man indeed, or of a truely reformed Protestant; to see the temper and spirit of those that are lately honoured, and that now bear the Rule in the Army; even men I say that look with the faces of the first ingagers, in whom the qualification of the Lamb souldiers that must pull down more and more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, is most resplendent in them: so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly Gods presence (which God called me before to remonstrate) is with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Government.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we would undoubtedly know the sign of that power that God hath exalted,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170580:8"/>it is this, That the Divel is never more tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, then to see as in the days of <hi>Q. E.</hi> a supreme Magistrate, as now exalted to pul down Antichrist, &amp; doth put into the heart, or possess the spirit of the malecontented, to seek revenge, or to attempt some overtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, where God hath peaceably setled; though some them as of <hi>Babington,</hi> and of <hi>Phrogmorton</hi> Gentlemen of quality, conspired against <hi>Q. E.</hi> in favour onely to promote the Roman religion; yet let their intensions be what they please: in this they so much displease God,
<note place="margin">Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from plots, &amp;c. is the seal of the power that is exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> that the Lord fights against them, to their own destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which is the seal of his approbation of his exalted servants, even to be delivered from, as <hi>Q. E.</hi> was from very many plots &amp; conspiracies, which at large is discoursed in my Tripartite Remonstrance. And yet in this Kingdom there is no want of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses: I do take no delight to remind how many sad spectacles of Gods indignation there are, that have fought against God, and therefore perished in denying the exalted power which God doth as in the field, so in secret appear to protect, and will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect when man hath done all that can be imagined. For when the heathen rage, and the Kings stand up against him, whom
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170580:9"/>Christ will have exalted, it is to provoke God to speak unto them in his rage, and to vex them in his hot displeasure, as in the exaltation of King <hi>David</hi> was often verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp;c. so now, and shall ever be while Christ exalts Kings under him untill his second coming.</p>
                  <p>Yet that with some it appears difficult in over-turning times to yield up themselves to true subjection is not to be questioned. For we often want Faith, to know and believe when God hath a design to pluck up one, and plant another, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, disaffections, prejudice, <hi>vox popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li</hi> sometimes hindred. Even as the ignorant multitude have cried out openly, We will not have this man rule over us: and the Malignant opposition, with the murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of some, is so great, that they disdain nothing more, but that they are not the Governors themselves, whom God will have governed. That we know that except <hi>Actus naturae &amp; gratiae,</hi> which Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> speaketh of be conjunctively ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, it is a wonder if we willingly to bee subject, or take satisfaction; yea if Angels from heaven could please us in this, to be sent from heaven to rule over us; from the observation whereof, and that the Native
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170580:10"/>subjects, (though questionlesse now God hath better informed them) our Native English men, as the French King was called <hi>Rex Assinornm,</hi> the King of Asses; so the English King was called <hi>Rex Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum,</hi> the King of Divels.</p>
                  <p>And such difficultie in this hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he that wrote <hi>Vera Obedientia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bishop Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner Lord Chancellor of England</note> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to own his own doctrine in the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning times of Queen <hi>Elisabeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For though it's true that all men do confesse, that it is in the Almighty's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative to pull down and set up Kings at his will and pleasure, yet there is not to be found one of a thousand, but desires to have a casting voice with God in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: So that when God sent Christ his Son the Messias, either place, person, splendor, or otherwife (though miracles, grace and glory bore witnesse) caused the foreskin of the heart, blindness and selvishness stilto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine upon them. And that we may see how many stumbling blocks are cast in the way, whereby in some respect our cordial subjection is found to be more difficult. It's notable to see how the Jesuites for this last hundred years have plai'd their parts, to harden the Papists to their way, in making them believe, that God would remove or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170580:11"/>subvert the present Government: So that a Romish Catholick could not so soon have a thought to come out of Babylon, but he was acquainted with a Plotor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy, which if it took effect, then to be a Papist was his security, whereby not knowing what might prevail, this stai'd him for the present to alter his resolutions, in which way of plotting against Queen <hi>Elisabeth,</hi> who being an exalted servant of God to destroy Antichrist; <hi>David</hi>-like living out as much as could be expected in the course of nature. All her time the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists were deluded, so difficult it was for to see their obedience, that her Successor <hi>James</hi> did cunningly comply with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist Prelatical, and yet did hearken to Doctor <hi>Reynolds,</hi> and the Millenarie Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe so then called; because a thousand Ministers did Petition the King by their Representatives at <hi>Nevil-crosse</hi> in Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick of <hi>Durham:</hi> Upon which account the King ordered a Conserence at <hi>Hampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court.</hi> The Papists saw not things so much smile upon them as they desired, so hard it is in times of over-turning, that here the Papists begin again to plot the never to be-forgotten Gunpowder-Treason.</p>
                  <p>And though to see King <hi>James</hi> his son
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170580:11"/>married to a Papist, and afterwards to see Popish Innovations, even as visible a face of Popery in the Altar and Genn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion: and to hear as I have heard gross Popery preached at <hi>Whitehall-hall,</hi> &amp;c. did bid the Papists plot no more, for all was looking with a face of returning unto them; so that now, as the Jesuites might suggest, if they should but have patience to reap the Harvest of all their former exspectations, it were no lesse precipitancie then mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; when Arms were now put into their hands to fight against the old Puritanes. Hence the difficultie of obeying raiseth it self like a high mountain, not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, or over-looked.</p>
                  <p>And as Satan with selvish principles doth work in the Papists behalf, so it's known by woful experience, that through vain hopes to overturn that which God hath blessed, settled and planted: some men of our times have troden and fallen into the same ways of perdition, so difficult it is to learn indeed the old doctrine, <hi>de vera obedientia,</hi> which notwithstanding is most especially to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, which leads me to the third, which is for the most part too lately lamented which cannot be too much remonstrated, <hi>viz.</hi>

And therefore, as God did most severely punish the Angels that kept not their State or Order, he is so much displeased with those that wil not humbly be subject to God the God of Order, in the order that he hath placed them; that is, to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170580:12"/>be humbly subject to their exalted Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, that we cannot fall down from a greater precipice of destruction.</p>

                  <p>Now if the <hi>fith Monarchy men</hi> succeed the Apostles in their Faith, Ordinances, and Government, or that they will sing, pray, baptize, receive the Lords Supper, pray for Magistrates, ordain Ministers, set rulers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Saints, and not at all suffer all the Saints to rule over us. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. acknowledge Scripture-Bishops like <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to ordain, and suffer none to preach, but such as are proved and separated.

                        <head>And some Evangelists.</head>
                        <p>That of this Church-officer, given up as it were for lost, obscured in the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Ministry, or waved as extraordinary, we may be impartially informed.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is generally acknowledged, or this is that which is most conceived of him, That the Evangelist was such an one that wrote the Gospel-Scripture; or that every one that doth preach in the ordinary Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry may not be so called; But <hi>Joh. Scapula</hi> transcends <hi>Pasor</hi> in his divine-like Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, who tells that they were called Evangelists, because they were <hi>secundi,</hi> as Apostles joyned with them, as associates in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170580:39"/>the office of the promulgating of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; and that <hi>Nulli Ecclesiae erant addicti,</hi> and that they were not bound to any limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted pastoral charge, unto which <hi>Bucanan</hi> in his Common Pleas complyeth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he maketh this Office to continue at the Apostles pleasure, as to assist them in the over-sight of Churches and Provinces: But this is but of small validity, except he believed that Church-Government cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the Apostles; for if they had need of help in the Government, then certainly the like help is not now to be denyed us, in regard the charge now is as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of Christ's Officers, as was in the time of the Apostles, who (as in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so in Government) were not in their execution of the same to be judged extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the Evangelists ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued as formerly, it doth appear in that the Officers upon whom this was confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, were <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> the one a Minister, and the other at the first but a Deacon, set a part to serve Tables; and to shew that it was an absolute distinct of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, this of the Evangelist: <hi>Timothy</hi> was required to do the work of an Evangelist, even to set the things in order that were
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170580:39"/>wanting, even to take the over-fight of Churches, and Presbyteries, in which <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> was known to labour.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And that the said Evangelists is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Officer, not Abrogated. <hi>Philip</hi> though before a Deacon, is from this office laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, not called as before, <hi>Philip</hi> the Deacon; but he is called <hi>Philip</hi> the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist, though as the Holy Ghost saith, He had been formerly called one of the seven Deacons.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. This said Evangelist is continued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is need for such an Officer in the Church:
<note place="margin">The rabsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities that arise by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the Evangelist.</note> for though some deny the Evangelist, yet they choose a Moderator for to supply the place of an Evangelist, otherwise they cannot uphold their Church Government.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 If this Evangelist should not, or some such other Officer be found so ordained, (as none is to be found) to take this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or necessary over-sight which is cast upon the Moderator, then these absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties would necessarily follow: First, that one ordinary Pastor should govern ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is a proud usurpation; or that Pastor might create an Officer to continue during pleasure, which would make the Divine Right turn into <hi>Jure Humano,</hi> or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170580:40"/>rather, <hi>Humano beneplacito,</hi> or that by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding an Officer, not extraordiary, we are forced to break the Rule, for to supply the want of the same Officer; all which, being by no means to be admitted, the Evangelist ought still to be retained as the Officer of the Church Catholicke, or Scripture Bishop.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. Because the Church which was first constituted, was by Gods Law subjected to the Magistrates over-sight, neither could it stand with the faithfulness of Christ, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogate any part of the Moral Law, which he came not to destroy, but to see fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Because in the foreseen vacancy of Magistrates (through judgment and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity) they are again promised and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied to be restored.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Because the Pope in the usurping of the Magistrates power in the Church, is condemned to be the man of sin, or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</p>

<note place="margin">Magistrate is the Judge of the Law.</note> is to judge of spirituall wickednesse, or unsound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: And that St. <hi>Paul</hi> said, He stood before <hi>Caesars</hi> Judgement seat, where he ought to be judged.</p>

                        <hi>So now again flourished those Apostolicall times (as I may say) of unity and uniformity of doctrine in our Church; for then were there no contentions, nor dissentors, nor thorny and pricking disputation amongst us, about questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Religion,</hi> Tantum res nobis cum Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellitibus quibusdam pontificiis (<hi>as Bishop</hi> Jewel <hi>said</hi>) <hi>we then skirmish onely with the Papists, as it was at the building of</hi> Solomons <hi>Temple, so it was with us then; we set on the building of Gods House, which is his Church, without din, without noise, and stirs, the

                  <p>And yet is not enough that this be onely done, but you must be so deliberate, faithfull, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and charitable, in this your undertaking, that you ought to judg it better not to know bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, then that any pretended Church, or an Angel or Archangel from heaven should Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize you in the way of Separation, from the Communiou of any Saint in the whole world, that believs these <hi>XII</hi> Articles of faith, as they are explained by the All-Christian Protestants.</p>

It's a great sin to deny Christs order, or to counterfeit or usurp the calling of the Minister, as not being Ordained, and thereby separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to preach the Gospel.</p>
                           <p>It's a sin to hear, so as to justifie or countenance such usurpers in their strange voice, if the people know them to be such: For none must preach but by way of probation; and if judged fit, must bee ordained and separated; and if not, silenced, as not called or qualified to be Gods Embassadors.</p>
                           <p>It were distrust of Christ that he should not in the way of his own appointment to send Laborers, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and Teachers into his Church or Vineyard, for the perfecting of the Saints.</p>
                           <p>We must wait, and not despise any who by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice have due honour, as they are called to be Christs Ministers. It was justice and truth in <hi>Paul</hi> as much to magnifie, as ungodly people do unjustly vilifie the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170580:94"/>office of the Ministrie, ordained to preach unto Christs flock, over which the Holy Ghost hath made them over-seers.</p>
